            <h1>Our Mission</h1>
            <p>"Once you've wrestled, everything else in life is easy."<br>
                -Dan Gable, Olympic Champion<br><br>
                We believe that nothing teaches life lessons like wrestling does. Wrestling makes athletes better athletes, helps students become better learners, and teaches the values that make good people. 
                <br><br>We want to make a positive impact in our youth's lives. Teaching that no goal is too big as long as you've got a plan, are willing to put the work in, and believe that you can achieve it!
