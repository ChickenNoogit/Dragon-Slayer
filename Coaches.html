<br>A life-long grappler and former Newport Knight, Coach Weisenburgh has dedicated his life to the art of wrestling, and to the advancement of his athletes. After high school, Shawn spent his college career wrestling as a Thunderbird at Highline College. After college, he travelled the world, training and competing in the sport of Jiu-Jitsu (submission wrestling) before earning his black belt in 2019. Besides developing killers on the mat, Shawn hopes that his athletes take away from the sport the ability to set high goals and see them to fruition. </p>

        <p><font size="+2">OUR VOLUNTEERS</font> <br> We are so grateful to the people who volunteer their time to help support youth wrestling. Anyone interested in volunteering must complete our training program, as well as a background check, first aid/ CPR certification, and a Safe Sport certification. During training, we will go over the How to Coach Kids program, as well as our club's coaching philosophies. If you're interested in hopping on the mat as a volunteer coach, contact coach Weisenburgh about the training.<p>
